Combining two different JavaScript files for a game like Dogetris, where each file handles different block types (1x4 and 2x2) but shares common functionalities like movement, rotation, and score management, presents a few challenges. Here are some steps and considerations to help guide the process of combining these files effectively:

1. Identify Common Functionalities
First, you need to identify the functionalities that are common between the two files. From your description, it seems both handle:

Block movement (left, right, down)
Block rotation
Score calculation
Game state management (starting, stopping)
Grid management (populating and clearing cells)
2. Resolve Naming and Structural Differences
The functions that perform similar tasks in both files may have different names or different implementations. You should standardize the names and try to unify the logic where possible. For example:

Standardize function names like moveBlock, canMoveBlock, rotateBlock, etc.
Ensure consistency in how blocks are represented and manipulated.
3. Modularize the Code
Separate the logic into modules based on functionality. For instance:

Movement Logic: Handling all directional moves.
Rotation Logic: Handling block rotations.
Grid Management: Populating cells, checking grid states.
Game State Management: Starting, stopping, and pausing the game.
Score Management: Calculating and updating scores.
4. Create Block Definitions
Since you have different types of blocks (1x4 and 2x2), you can define these blocks in terms of their shapes and rotation states in a separate module or file. This can help in simplifying the rotation and movement logic by abstracting these details away from the main game logic.

5. Implement a Game Loop
Ensure there’s a central game loop that manages the flow of the game. This loop should handle the spawning of new blocks, checking for game over conditions, and transitioning between different states like moving and placing blocks.

6. Testing and Refactoring
Once you have combined the initial version, test the game thoroughly to catch and fix any bugs. Refactor the code to improve efficiency and maintainability.

7. Documentation
Document your combined codebase thoroughly to make it easier to understand and modify in the future. This includes comments within the code and external documentation if necessary.

Suggested Steps to Proceed:
Step 1: Start by creating a new JavaScript file, maybe named combined.js.
Step 2: Decide on the structure and naming conventions you will use.
Step 3: Gradually integrate functionalities from both files into this new file, starting with basic grid setup and block initialization.
Step 4: Add movement and rotation logic, making sure to accommodate both block types.
Step 5: Implement score and game state management.
Step 6: Test with one block type at a time, then both together.
Example of Unified Function Structure:
Here’s a simplified example of what part of your unified file might look like, focusing on game setup and basic movement:
